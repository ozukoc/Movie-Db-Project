<h1>Movie Database Creator</h1>
<h3>Using Flask, SQLAlchemy and  themoviedb.org api</h3>

With this tool you can create your "watched/will watch movies site" that you can search for movies with an api key <br> and then add the selected movie to database with a comment and rating. All the movies will be shown on the homepage with descending order of ratings that you gave for it. <br><br>
I created this project while learning python from udemy course and it is simple and clean looking yet effectife base for many projects like this. That's why I will keep it in my repos. Hope you like it.
